**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

Padding is internal spacing in a div, border is external, and margin is external as well.  In conjunction with placement on a page, sometimes do the math to make sure things are positioned correctly, so box-sizing is a useful property to know.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

Michael, my guide from my GPS, wisely suggested not to mix floats with positioning types with display modes.  Just float everything left, fix float issues with a clearfix, and move on.  

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

Getting things centered and aligned were difficult.  Also just making design decisions in general can be a bit mystifying - I'm trying to fulfill some sort of aesthetic in my head that I can't quite articulate (hence leading me to spend like 20 minutes choosing fonts).  However, that in of itself can be the fun part - I do enjoy making things look "pretty" and user friendly.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

Float left, and clearfix is your friend, and always give yourself twice the amount of time you think you need for making CSS happen.
