	<h2>Functions</h2>
	<p>Keeping my head straight around how to use functions as well as flow in the code is a bit of task, as such I figured I would reiterate how to declare functions in both Javascript and Ruby.  Well, mainly in Javascript.
	<div class="row clearfix">

			<h4>Ruby</h4>
			<p>Defining a method in Ruby</p>
<pre class="ruby">
def a_method
	# do something
	return something
end

yayz = a_method
</pre>
			<p>Boom. Done.  And the last line calls the method and assigns it to a variable.</p>
			<pre>
			</pre>
		</div>
		<div class="column column-right">
			<h4>Javascript</h4>
			<p>Defining a function in JS, as a function declaration</p>
<pre class="javascript">
function aDeclaredFunction {
	//do something
	return something;
}

var yayz = aDeclaredFunction;
</pre>
			<p>Okay...easy, right?  Hold tight...</p>
<pre class="javascript">
var aFunctionExpression = function { 
	//do something
	return something;
 }
var yayz = aFunctionExpression
</pre>
			<p>
			Say what?  Well, it's called a function expression.  It allows you to assign an anonymous function to a variable, and that function gets called whenever that variable is used.  (You can also name a function expression, but that's less common.)
			</p>
			<p>And this is where the fun part starts.  If you use a function declaration (first example), it means that the function is moved to the top of the metaphysical code flow.  As such, you can call a function before you declare it.
			</p>
<pre class="javascript">
var yayz = aDeclaredFunction;

function aDeclaredFunction {
	//do something
	return something;
}
</pre>
			<p>
			And the last way to make a function in JS is to use a function constructor.  Since functions are objects in JS, they have a constructor.
			</p>
<pre class="javascript">
var aConstructedFunction = new Function() {
	// do something
	return something
}

var yayz = aConstructedFunction;
</pre>

			<p>
			I said that this example was the last way to declare a function in JS...well, there is one more way, except things get all kind of weird because you can both express the function and the immediately invoke it.
			</p>
<pre class="javascript">
(function() {
	// do something
	return something
})();
</pre>
			<p>
			Woah.

		<p>Some fun facts about functions for you...</p>
		<div class="column column-left">
			<h4>Ruby</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Ruby does NOT have nested methods. (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/4865161">More explanation</a>)</li>
				<li>Functions are normally referred to as methods, period. (Well, actually, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/928443/ruby-functions-vs-methods">most argue</a> that there aren't even functions in Ruby, as functions are objectless methods, and Ruby is a completely OO language).</li>
				<li>Ruby has <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/closures-ruby/">closures</a>!  But they are weird, too</li>
				<li>Ruby has these interesting things called <a href="http://awaxman11.github.io/blog/2013/08/05/what-is-the-difference-between-a-block/">Procs and lambdas</a> that can help you create a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4268227/ruby-equivalent-to-a-javascript-self-executing-function">self invoking block of code</a>. 
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="column column-right">
			<h4>Javascript</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Javascript totally has nested methods, yippee!</li>
				<li>A method is a function inside of an object.</li>
				<li>Variable scoping is super important in Javascript, and self invoking functions have a fun thing called <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_closures.asp">closures</a>.</li>
