  <h2>Git It</h2>
  <h4>Git & Version Control</h4>

      I have been excited to learn about Git in it's full mastery from DBC - I have picked up bits and pieces over time, but never stitched everything together in an understandable, full picture work flow.

      Git as a version control system is extraordinarily beneficial for developers - it allows for a multi layered/tiered saving system. You can see the history of saves easily, backtrack along that history, and work from different points in the save history.  Version control also helps with having multiple contributers to a project, as each contributer can be working on a separate (or even the same!) piece of the project and then merge things together.

      Git can help keep track of changes made via the commit process.  Commits are essentially snapshots of the file at a given time, and saves them as individual files, so you can go back in a commit's history and see all the changes that have been made.  It also allows for a main or 'master' file where the final version of the project is kept, thus keeping a pristine/finalized version of all the changes made.
    </p>

      Whereas Git is located on your local drive, Github is a great resource/tool that works in conjunction with your local Git.  Github is essentially a social hub of code editing and sharing - it allows you to see other people's projects, as well as easily have multiple contributers on your project.  You can easily navigate pull requests from members on your team, and solve any merge conflicts.
