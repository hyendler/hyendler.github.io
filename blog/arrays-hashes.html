  <h2>Hash It Out</h2>
  <h4>Hashes & Arrays</h4>
  <h5>11/19/15</h5>

  <section>
    <p>
      I was excited to finally start up Ruby again after HTML & CSS, as it allows more room for playing with logic.  Hashes and arrays are especially dear - they are essentially the same as matrices from math class (can't wait until we are dealing with big sets of data and nested arrays!).  Manipulating data to produce useful results 
    </p>
      But why are hashes and arrays that interesting and important?  Arrays are great for storing lists of singular elements, whereas hashes can store key-value pairs, which allow for a more flexible relationship because you can give your element a specific name or 'key'.  Once can almost think of an array like a hash, but has an automatic relationship determined by it's index number.  
    <p>
      Even though hashes and arrays are different from each other, manipulating, accessing and iterating over them are nearly the same.
