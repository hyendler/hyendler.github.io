<!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
N/a.  Didn't do this with a pair, am still catching up on the work.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yep, absolutely!

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
Good wireframes are simple, without interactivity added, or color/design.  Mostly focusing on layout and functionality.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
n/a
