    <p>Understanding the conceptual difference between classes and IDs was a little mind boggling at first (but perhaps that was because I was just so excited to finally be adding pretty colors to web page that I didn't pay too much attention to the learning materials I was given).  But, once I learned about the so-called "CSS points system/hierarchy", it made a lot more sense.  Classes are reusable pieces of applied CSS, whereas IDs are meant to denote import/specific sections and be used only once.
